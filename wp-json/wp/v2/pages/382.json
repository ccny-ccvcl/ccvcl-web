The motion of the camera has a dominant direction of motion (as on an airplane or ground vehicle), but 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) motion is allowed. In the first step, a pair of generalized parallel-perspective (pushbroom) stereo mosaics is generated that captured both the 3D and dynamic aspects of the scene under the camera coverage. In the second step, a segmentation-based stereo matching algorithm is applied to extract parametric representation of the color, structure and motion of the dynamic and\/or 3D objects in urban scenes where a lot of planar surfaces exist. Based on these results, the content-based 3D mosaic (CB3M) representation is created, which is a highly compressed visual representation for very long video sequences of dynamic 3D scenes. Our goal is to acquire geo-referenced 3D mosaic maps with motion tracking information for 3D (moving) targets using a light aerial vehicle flying over or a ground vehicle move across an unknown 3D environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sponsors<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NSF I-Corps<\/strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/nsf.gov\/awardsearch\/showAward?AWD_ID=1243737\">Award #1243737<\/a>): Transforming 2D Video into an Interactive 3D Viewing Experience, Zhigang Zhu (PI), Edgardo Molina (EL), Peng Chang and John Blaho (IMs), Duration: July 1, 2012 &#8211; August 31, 2013<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC)<\/strong>, Three-Dimensional Rendering of EO and IR Images.
