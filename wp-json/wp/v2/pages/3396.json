Writing Assignments (10\u00d74 = 40 points)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>(1). How does an image change (e.g., objects\u2019 sizes in the image, field of view, etc.) when you change the zoom factors of your pinhole camera (i.e., the focal length of a pinhole camera is changed)?<br>(2). Give an intuitive explanation why a pinhole camera has an infinite depth of field, i.e., the images of objects are always sharp regardless their distances from the camera.<br>(3). In the thin lens model, 1\/o + 1\/i = 1\/f, there are three variables, the focal length f, the object distance o and the image distance i (please refer to the Slides of the Image Formation lecture). If we define Z = o-f, and z = i-f, please write a few words to describe the physical meanings of Z and z, and then prove that Z*z = f*f given 1\/o + 1\/i = 1\/f.<br>(4). Prove that, in the pinhole camera model, three collinear points in the world (i.e., they lie on a line&nbsp; in 3D space) are imaged into three collinear points on the image plane. You may either use geometric reasoning (with line drawings) or algebra deduction (using equations).<br><br><strong>II. Programming&nbsp; Assignments (<\/strong>Matlab preferred \u2013 here is a&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/matlab.pdf\">quick matlab tutorial<\/a>. &nbsp;You may use C++, Java or Python if you like, but you may need to show the running of your program during my office hours when I ask you.

The purpose of the project is to make you familiar with the basic digital image formations. Your program should do the following things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Read in a color image C1(x,y) = (R(x,y), G(x,y), B(x,y)) in Windows BMP format, and display it.<\/li><li>Display the images of the three color components, R(x,y), G(x,y) and B(x,y), separately. You should display three black-white-like images.<\/li><li>Generate an intensity image I(x,y) and display it. You should use the equation I = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B (the NTSC standard for luminance) and tell us what are the differences between the intensity image thus generated from the one generated using a simple average of the R, G and B components. Please use an algorithm to show the differences instead by just observing the images by your eyes.<\/li><li>The original intensity image should have 256 gray levels.&nbsp; Please uniformly quantize this image into K levels ( with K=4, 16, 32, 64).&nbsp; As an example,&nbsp; when K=2,&nbsp; pixels whose values are below 128 are turned to 0,&nbsp; otherwise to 255.&nbsp; Display the four quantized images with four different K levels,&nbsp; and tell us&nbsp;how the images still look like or different from the original ones, and where you cannot see any differences.<\/li><li>Quantize&nbsp; the original three-band color image C1(x,y) into K level color images CK(x,y)= (R'(x,y), G'(x,y), B'(x,y)) (with uniform intervals) , and display them. You may choose K=2 and 4 (for each band).&nbsp; Do they have any advantages in viewing and\/or in computer processing (e.g. transmission or segmentation)?<\/li><li>Quantize&nbsp; the original three-band color image C1(x,y) into a color image CL(x,y)= (R'(x,y), G'(x,y), B'(x,y)) (with a logarithmic function) , and display it. You may choose&nbsp; a function&nbsp; I\u2019 =C ln (I+1) ( for each band), where I is the original value (0~255) , I\u2019 is the quantized value,&nbsp; and C is a constant to scale I\u2019&nbsp; into (0~255), and ln is the natural logarithmic function.&nbsp; Please describe how you find the best C value so for an input in the range of 0-255, the output range is still 0 \u2013 255. Note that when I = 0, I\u2019 = 0 too.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Please for each of the above (1-6), provide your analysis \/ observations \/ conclusions, rather than just show the experimental results in images and\/or charts.<\/strong>&nbsp;I have provided a piece of&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www-cs.engr.ccny.cuny.edu\/~zhu\/CSCI6716-2018s\/Homework\/ImageFormat.m\">starting code<\/a>&nbsp;for you to use.
