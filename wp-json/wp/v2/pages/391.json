In this project, a linear pushbroom scanning model is built for such a commonly used gamma-ray or x-ray cargo inspection system. Three-dimensional (3D) measurements of the objects inside a cargo can be obtained by effectively constructing a pushbroom stereo system using two such scanning systems with different scanning angles. A simple but robust calibration method is proposed to find the important parameters of the linear pushbroom sensors. Then, a fast stereo matching algorithm is developed to obtain 3D measurements of the objects under inspection. This algorithm is fully automatic based on free-form deformable registration. An interactive user interface is designed for 3D visualization of the objects of interest. Using the interactive tool, the automatic algorithm is also compared with a very simple semi-automatic algorithm based on point correlation. Experimental results of sensor calibration, stereo matching, 3D measurements and visualization of a 3D cargo container and the objects inside, are presented.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sponsors<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AFRL<\/strong>&nbsp;RASER Program (Award No. FA8650-05-1-1853), Dynamic Pushbroom Stereo Mosaics for 3D and Moving Target Extraction &#8211; A New Geometric Approach, 03\/07\/2005 \u2013 09\/06\/2009, PI &#8211; Z.
