All eligible undergraduate STEM students, high school students and STEM teachers (US citizens, nationals and permanent residents) are encouraged to apply for this 10-week intensive research program as Research Participants (RPs). The priority will be given to underrepresented groups, including persons with disabilities, females, veterans and underrepresented minorities. High school students going to junior or senior years in Fall 2014, whose GPA are above 85% with Math average above 90% and have good writing and presenting skills, are strongly encouraged to apply. The RPs will have opportunities to work in our labs, with both faculty and PhD students, on cutting edge research projects sponsored by National Science Foundation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past several years, the three PIs (Zhu, Tian and Ro) of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nsf.gov\/awardsearch\/showAward?AWD_ID=1137172\">EFRI-M3C project (#1137172)<\/a>&nbsp;have been working on assistive technologies to help the blind and visually impaired. As faculty from three different departments (computer science, electrical engineering, psychology), this project draws on our diverse expertise in multimodal sensing, computer vision, and human perception and action. For more information on the project, please see this&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ccny.cuny.edu\/news\/CCNY-led-Research-Could-Lead-to-Wearable-Sensors-for-Blind.cfm\">news post<\/a>. We have successfully run the REM summer research program in the summers of 2012, 2013, and 2014, which has brought in about 10 under-represented students as Research Participants (RPs) in a 10-week research program each year, with follow-ups of their education and career paths in the rest of the year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Research Experience and Mentoring 2015 Important Dates Application Deadline:&nbsp;March 15, 2015 Acceptance Notification: May 15, 2015 Overview National Science Foundation (NSF) seeks to encourage EFRI-supported researchers to create carefully mentored&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/487"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=487"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/487\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":490,"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/487\/revisions\/490"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=487"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
