Due to deep learning tremendous progress has been made and several high-performance methods have been proposed. This extraordinary success of deep learning methods can be mostly attributed to advancements in supervised learning algorithms and the availability of large-scale labeled datasets. However, constructing large, labeled video datasets for supervised learning tends to be costly and is often infeasible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this talk, I will discuss our recent work on human action recognition employing learning with less labels. In particular, I will present our work employing Semi-supervised learning (SSL), Self-supervised learning and Zero-short learning. First, I will present our Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Selection (UPS) method for semi-supervised learning, which improves pseudo labeling accuracy by drastically reducing the amount of noise encountered in the training process. Next, I will present self-supervised method, TCLR: Temporal Contrastive Learning for Video Representations, which is a new temporal contrastive learning framework consisting of two novel losses to improve upon existing contrastive self-supervised video representation learning method.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I will present Pairwise-Similarity Zero-shot Action Recognition (PS-ZAR) method.&nbsp; Given a video and a set of action classes, our method predicts a set of confidence scores for each class independently. This allows for the prediction of several semantically distinct classes within one video input.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Advances in action recognition have enabled a wide range of real-world applications, e.g. video surveillance camera, smart shopping systems, elderly person monitor systems. Most of these video understanding applications involve extensive computation, for which a user needs to share the video data to the cloud computation server, where the user also ends up sharing the&nbsp; private visual information like gender, skin color, clothing, background objects etc. Therefore, there is a pressing need for solutions to privacy preserving action recognition. I will end this talk by briefly discuss our recent method SPAct: Self-supervised Privacy Preservation for Action Recognition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color\">Watch [<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/hQK9LsQ0SDc\">Here<\/a>] <\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color\">Biography<\/span>:<\/strong>&nbsp;Dr. Mubarak Shah, the UCF Trustee Chair Professor, is the founding director of Center for Research in Computer Visions at University of Central Florida (UCF).
