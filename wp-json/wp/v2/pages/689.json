Discuss the dependence of the error in depth estimation as a function of disparity error, depth itself, the baseline width and the focal length, respectively.<br><br>     Hint: Z = fB\/d; Take the partial derivatives of Z with respect to d,  B, f,&nbsp; respectively. <br><br>     2. (Motion- 25 points) Could you obtain 3D information of a scene by  viewing the scene by a camera&nbsp; rotating around its optical  center? <strong>Show why or why not.<\/strong> What about moving the camera along its optical axis?<strong>     <\/strong><br><br>     3. (25 points) Discussion the similarities (at least 2 ) and  differences (at least 2) between stereo vision and visual motion .<br><br>     4. (25 points) Give five examples where humans use stereo and  motion, and Google another five examples that use machine vision  algorithms of stereo and motion. <br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Extending the CCNY Joint Senior Design Program on Assistive Technology Across School Boundaries CSc 59866\/59867 Capstone I\/II (Section 1CD) Fall 2019 &#8211; Spring 2020 CS\/CpE\/EE Joint Senior Design + BIC&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":515,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"page-templates\/fullwidth.php","meta":{"footnotes":""},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/689"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=689"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/689\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":697,"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/689\/revisions\/697"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/515"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=689"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
