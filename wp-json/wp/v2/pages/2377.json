Please show steps of your proof.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hint:<\/strong>&nbsp;You can either use geometric reasoning or algebraic calculation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you choose to use geometric reasoning, you can use the fact that the projection of a 3D line in space is the intersection of its \u201cinterpretation plane\u201d with the image plane.&nbsp; Here the interpretation plane (IP) is a plane passing through the 3D line and the center of projection (viewpoint) of the camera.&nbsp; Also, the interpretation planes of two parallel lines intersect in a line passing through the viewpoint, and the intersection line is parallel to the parallel lines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you select to use algebraic calculation, you may use the parametric representation of a 3D line: P = P0 +tV, where P= (X,Y,Z)<sup>T<\/sup>&nbsp;is any point on the line (here&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>T<\/sup>&nbsp;denote for transpose),&nbsp;&nbsp; P0 = (X0,Y0,Z0)<sup>T<\/sup>&nbsp;is a given fixed point on the line, vector V = (a,b,c)<sup>T<\/sup>&nbsp;represents the direction of the line, and t is the scalar parameter that controls the distance (with sign) between P and P0.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.

Note that in the course slides and the lecture notes, I used a simplified model of the perspective project by assuming ox and oy are known and sx = sy =1, and only discussed the special cases of a plane. So you cannot directly copy those equations I used.&nbsp; Instead you should use the general form of the projective matrix, and the&nbsp; general form of a plane n<sub>x<\/sub>&nbsp;X<sub>w<\/sub>&nbsp;+ n<sub>y<\/sub>&nbsp;Y<sub>w<\/sub>&nbsp;+ n<sub>z<\/sub>&nbsp;Z<sub>w<\/sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= d.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.\u00a0\u00a0(Calibration- 50 points )\u00a0 Prove the Orthocenter Theorem by geometric arguments: Let T be the triangle on the image plane defined by the three vanishing points of three mutually orthogonal sets of parallel lines in space. Then the image center is the orthocenter of the triangle T (i.e., the common intersection of the three altitudes.\u00a0 Note that you are asked to prove the Orthocenter Theorem rather than that the orthocenter itself as the common interaction of the three altitudes, which you can use as a fact.<br>(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Basic proof: use the result of Question 1, assuming the aspect ratio of the camera is 1.
