Writing Assignments (10&#215;4 = 40 points)<br>       &nbsp; <\/strong>(1). How does an image change (e.g., objects&#8217; sizes in the image, field of view, etc.) if the focal length of a pinhole camera is varied? <br>     (2). Give an intuitive explanation of  the reason why a pinhole camera has an infinite depth of field.<br>     (3). In the thin lens model, 1\/o + 1\/i = 1\/f, there are three variables, the focal length f, the object distance o and the image distance i (please refer to Slide # 19 of   the Image Formation lecture). If we define Z = o-f, and z     = i-f, please write two a few words to describe the physical meanings of Z and z, and  then prove that Z*z = f*f given 1\/o + 1\/i = 1\/f.<br>     (4). Prove that, in the pinhole camera model, three  collinear points (i.e., they lie on a line)&nbsp; in 3D space are imaged into three collinear points on the image plane. You may  either use geometric reasoning (with line drawings) or algebra  deduction (using equations).<br><br><strong>2. Programming&nbsp; Assignments (Matlab preferred &#8211; here is a <a href=\"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/matlab.pdf\">quick matlab tutorial<\/a>. &nbsp;You may use C++ or Java if you like, but you may need to bring  your&nbsp; own machine to me in my office hours to run       your programs when I ask you. If you don&#8217;t have a Matlab license, <strong>CUNY has  recently made several software available for use ( including  MathWorks MatLab), through the <a href=\"http:\/\/www2.cuny.edu\/about\/administration\/offices\/cis\/virtual-desktop\/\">CUNY Virtual Desktop<\/a>. <\/strong>)<\/strong> (15&#215;4 = 60 points)<br><br>Image formation.&nbsp; In this small project, you are going to use Matlab to read, manipulate and write image data. The purpose of the project is to make you familiar with the basic digital image formations. Your program should do the following things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Read in a color image C1(x,y) = (R(x,y), G(x,y), B(x,y)) in         Windows BMP format, and display it.<\/li><li>Display the images of the three color components, R(x,y), G(x,y) and B(x,y), separately. You should display three  black-white-like images.<\/li><li>Generate an intensity image I(x,y) and display it. You should use the equation I = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B (the NTSC standard for luminance) and tell us what are the differences of the intensity image thus generated from the one using a simple average of the R, G and B components.<\/li><li>The original intensity image should have 256 gray levels.&nbsp; Please uniformly quantize this image into K levels ( with K=4, 16, 32, 64).&nbsp; As an example,&nbsp; when K=2,&nbsp; pixels whose values are below 128 are turned to 0,&nbsp; otherwise to 255.&nbsp; Display the four quantized         images with four different K levels&nbsp; and tell us&nbsp; how the images still look like the original ones.        <\/li><li>Quantize&nbsp; the original three-band color image C1(x,y) into K level color images CK(x,y)= (R'(x,y),  G'(x,y), B'(x,y)) (with uniform intervals) , and display them.  You may choose K=2 and 4 (for each band).&nbsp; Do they have any  advantages in viewing and\/or in computer processing (e.g. segmentation)?<\/li><li>Quantize&nbsp; the original three-band color image C1(x,y) into a color image CL(x,y)= (R'(x,y), G'(x,y),  B'(x,y)) (with a logarithmic function) , and display it. You may choose&nbsp; a function&nbsp; I&#8217; =C ln (I+1) ( for each band),  where I is the original value (0~255) , I&#8217; is the quantized         value,&nbsp; and C is a constant to scale I&#8217;&nbsp; into (0~255),  and ln is the natural logarithm.&nbsp; Please describe how you find the best C value so for an input in the range of 0-255, the output range is still 0 &#8211; 255. Note that when I = 0, I&#8217; = 0 too.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Please for each of the above, provide your analysis \/ observations \/ conclusions, rather than just show the experimental results in images and\/or charts.<\/strong>   I have provided a piece of <a href=\"http:\/\/www-cs.engr.ccny.cuny.edu\/~zhu\/CSCI6716-2018s\/Homework\/ImageFormat.m\">starting code<\/a>  for you to use.
