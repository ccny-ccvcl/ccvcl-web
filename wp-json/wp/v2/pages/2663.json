Towards the end, Benjamin will provide resources that the audience can use to gain a better understanding of the subject matter. <strong>Jin<\/strong> will share her internship experience at the NYC Office of Comptroller as an IT auditor, in terms of how the government uses the existing federal and state policies to evaluate public IT systems. Jin will then discuss how her startups have considered and applied these policies in designing the application\u2019s system architecture of protecting the privacy and security of clients\u2019 data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color\">Watch [<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/CsYUswQlypE\">Here<\/a>]<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color\">Benjamin Rosado\u2019s Bio<\/span>:<\/strong>Benjamin Rosado is an intern intelligence analyst for the Department of Homeland Security.
