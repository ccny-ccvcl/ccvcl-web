Vibration of the objects caused by voice reflects the voice itself. After the enhancement with a Gaussian bandpass filtering and an adaptive volume scaling, the LDV voice signals were mostly intelligible from targets without retro-reflective finishes at short or medium distances (&lt; 100m). By using retro-reflective tapes, the distance could be as far as 300 meters. Infrared (IR) imaging for target selection and localization was also discussed for LDV listening. A system has been set up with three types of sensors (IR cameras, PTZ color cameras and LDVs) for performing integration of multimedia sensors in human signature detection. The basic idea is to provide an advanced augmented interface in order to give users the best cognitive understanding of the environment, the sensors and the events.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research challenge is, without retro-reflective tape treatment, the LDV voice signals were still very noisy from targets at medium and large distances. Therefore, with the state-of-the-art sensor technology, more advanced signal enhancement techniques are needed. Further sensor improvement is also necessary. In addition, automatic targeting and intelligent refocusing is a technical issue that deserves research attention for long range LDV listening. To improve the performance and the efficiency of Laser Doppler Vibrometers (LDVs) for long-range hearing, we design an active multimodal sensing platform that integrates a Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) camera, a mirror and a Pan-Tilt-Unit (PTU) to the LDV . With the assistance of the vision and active control components, the LDV can automatically select the best reflective surfaces, point the laser beam to the selected surfaces, and quickly focus the laser beam. For accomplishing these functions, distance measurement and sensor calibration methods are proposed using the triangulation between the PTZ camera and the mirrored LDV laser beam. Based on both the measured distances and the return signal levels of the LDV, a fast and automatic LDV focusing algorithm is designed. Furthermore, strategies of surface selection and laser pointing are designed for the platform to automatically point the laser beam to the designated surfaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www-cs.engr.ccny.cuny.edu\/~zhu\/LDV\/LDV2007\/LDV-Hearing.html\">Hear some voice clips captured by the LDV sensor<\/a><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Related Publications and Links<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Y.
