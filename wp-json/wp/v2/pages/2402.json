ROBERTS is a Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at Rutgers University and Director of the Command, Control, and Interoperability Center for Advanced Data Analysis (CCICADA), which was founded as a Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence (COE). For 16 years he directed DIMACS, the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science, which was founded as one of the original NSF Science and Technology Centers. He is Director Emeritus and Senior Advisor to DIMACS. Roberts is author of four books, editor of 25 other books, and author of over 200 scientific articles. His recent edited books include the first book on maritime cyber security in 2017, a 2019 book on \u201cMathematics of Planet Earth,\u201d and a 2021 book on \u201cResilience in the Digital Age.\u201d His work has been translated into Russian and Chinese and deals with such varied topics as decision making, measurement, epidemiology, sustainability, large venue security, supply chain resilience, disasters and pandemics, maritime cyber security, global environmental change, socially responsible algorithms, mathematical psychology, discrete mathematics, and precollege education. His recent contributions include best practices for stadium security widely used by the NFL, NBA, NHL, and Major League Baseball; a ground-breaking simulation of the world\u2019s busiest bus terminal in NYC; automated tools to help TSA adjudicate applications from aviation workers with a criminal record. He led the DHS COE-wide Initiative on supply chains during COVID, including distribution of vaccines, PPE, and food, and currently leads several research projects on complex disruptions of supply chains. Roberts has received the Commemorative Medal of the Union of Czech Mathematicians and Physicists and the Distinguished Service Award of the Association of Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory. He is a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society, received the NSF Science and Technology Centers Pioneer Award, and was awarded the title Docteur Honoris Causa by the University of Paris-Dauphine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center wp-block-heading\"><strong><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color\">Complete colloquium schedule&nbsp;[<a href=\"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/ic-cae-ai4ia\/\">HERE<\/a>]<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>AI and Homeland Security Fred S.
