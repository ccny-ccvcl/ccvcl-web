The project aims to collaborate with NJ Transit and Port Authority, to create and test Smart Transportation Hub (Smart T-Hub) with minimal changes of the current cyber-physical infrastructure of their stations to serve people who have traveling challenges, including travelers who are blind or with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The SAT-Hub testbed is leading to project inspired discovery at least in the following areas: (1) 3D semantic facility model based localization with smartphone images, which offers a renovation- or reconstruction-free infrastructure approach for user localization and meanwhile provides a way of facility model updating. (2) Optimal sensor placement and rapid calibration using 3D semantic model in 3D space, which will advance our understanding in deploying smart sensors in a complex and large-scale dynamic environment. (3) Deep-learning-based human crowd analysis, which will go beyond the typical image classification and understanding tasks for deep learning into complex 3D environments. (4) Human-in-the-loop traveling guidance with multi-facet inputs, including information of physical 3D models, crowd and traffic flows, security alerts, transportation schedules and user preferences. The research is supported by the DHS Summer Research Team (SRT) Program, the NSF Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI) Program and most recently by the NSF Smart and Connected Community (S&amp;CC) Program, the NSF Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) Program, Bentley Systems, Inc., and the ODNI Intelligence Community Center of Academic Excellence (IC CAE) at Rutgers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sponsors<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>National Science Foundation Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) Program<\/strong>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nsf.gov\/awardsearch\/showAward?AWD_ID=1827505\">Award #1827505<\/a>) Division Of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships (IIP) (Program Director: Jesus Soriano Molla): FPI-RP: Smart and Accessible Transportation Hub for Assistive Navigation and Facility Management.
