The joint senior design program builds on our existing the six-credit capstone\/senior design course structure in CS and EE, but with a new concentration on assistive technologies for people in need. In the past eight years, over 180 students have graduated from our joint program.   However, our STEM students lack a more systematic approach on how to successfully communicate with the users, investors, stakeholders and community partners to really make their breakthrough work ACTIONABLE. Additionally, their lack of entrepreneurship skills and enthusiasm hinder them from turning their brilliant ideas into reality. THEREFORE we will to tap into CCNY\u2019s resources (BIC program and the Zahn Center) teach them useful and practical the branding, storytelling and entrepreneurship skills they need.                         <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Entering the ninth year of the joint program, we are inspired by the Campus Engagement Network (CEN), in terms of creative designs, cross-school collaboration, and community involvement. Supported by the course innovation grant from Moxie Foundation, we at the Grove School of Engineering work with the Branding + Integrated Communications (BIC) Creative Track in the Media and Communication Department and Zahn Innovation Center to push our Assistive Technology program to a new level. This will be a collaboration across school board, and the common theme for the three parties \u2013 GSOE, BIC and Zahn will be the promotion of social good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Capstone I  Course Syllabus Fall 2019<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ccny.cuny.edu\/registrar\/fall-2019-academic-calendar\">Fall 2019  academic calendar<\/a>)<br> Capstone I <em>Class Meet Time &amp; Location:    Monday 11:00AM &#8211; 01:30PM  Room: NAC 6\/268<br> Office Hours:   Thursday 2:30 &#8211; 4:30 pm,  Room: NAC 8\/211  <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Week 1<\/strong> (09\/05 TH).
