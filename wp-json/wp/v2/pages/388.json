The sensor integrates the following components: high accurate 3D measurements via a projection grating phase method; hyperspectral acquisition with the use of an Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter; and complete Stokes polarization acquisition based on Liquid Crystal Variable Retarder. All of the three components share the same set of optical system and the measurements are imaged on a single focal plane array. This design also features adaptive data collection in hyperspectral, polarization and 3D measurements. The precise co-alignment design avoids the problem of multimodal registration and the multimodal adaptive sensing improves the data acquisition efficiency, therefore improves the overall accuracy and efficiency of target detection and recognition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sponsors<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>China National Science Foundation<\/strong>, Study on key techniques of integrated detection for full-optics parameters, 1\/2007-12\/2009, Co-PI: Yufu Qu<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/research-projects\/\">Back<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Project Status:\u00a0Active (Started: 2004) Research Description We presented a novel single-array multimodal sensor that can obtain three-dimensional (3D), hyperspectral, and complete Stokes polarization images of targets from the same viewpoint.&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/388"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=388"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/388\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":389,"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/388\/revisions\/389"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=388"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
