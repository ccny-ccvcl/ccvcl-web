First, the modeling of individual wall-climber module, as well as the cooperative relationship of a group of such robots will be developed. Second, intelligent control methods will be designed to effectively coordinate the robot team to achieve a common goal (e.g., self-deployment, dynamic view planning, and object tracking, etc.) in a fault tolerant fashion. Third, based on our previous research in computer vision, new vision algorithms for scene understanding, object tracking and localization will be developed by taking advantage the climbing feature of multiple wall-climbers in 3-D environments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sponsors<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DOD Army Research Office<\/strong>\u00a0(Award number: W911NF-05-1-0011), Cooperative Wall-climbing Robots in 3-D Environment for Surveillance and Target Tracking, 11\/01\/04-11\/14\/2008, PI: J.
