We are actually solving four problems: 1) how to generate seamless panoramic view images (PVIs) and epipolar plane images (EPIs) from video under a more general motion than a pure translation; 2) how to analyze the huge amount of data in EPIs robustly and efficiently to obtain dense depth information; 3) how to enhance resolution and recover occlusions in a PVI representation; and 4) how to represent a large scale 3D scene with occlusions efficiently and compactly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sponsors<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>China National Science Foundation<\/strong>&nbsp;(Award No. 69805003), Evolution of Vision Algorithms for the Constructing of Layered Scene Models, 01\/99-12\/01, Principal Investigator (Z.
