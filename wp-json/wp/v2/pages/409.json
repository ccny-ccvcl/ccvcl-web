The dimensional measurements are obtained by using flexible image lenses, flexible illumination, high-accuracy date processing and reliable system construction. The system includes: an auto-focus component, an illumination intensity control component, a motion control component, and an automatic position component. The measurement resolution of the system is \u00b10.1\u03bcm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sponsors<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Article Numbering Center of China<\/strong>, Development of bar code measurement instrument based on imaging techniques, 04\/2001-06\/2003, Co-PI (Yufu Qu)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>YTO Group Corporation in Luoyang<\/strong>, Development of image coordinate measuring machines, 07\/2000-08\/2002, Co-PI (Yufu Qu)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Heilongjiang Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision<\/strong>, Development of vision measurement system of microelectronics products, 10\/1999-06\/2001, Co-PI (Yufu Qu)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>China Astronautics Times Electrical Company<\/strong>, Development of high accuracy on-line measurement system of tendon thickness of flexible connector, 1\/2003-06\/2004, Co-PI (Yufu Qu)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/research-projects\/\">Back<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Project Status:\u00a0Complete (Years: 1999 &#8211; 2004) Research Description We proposed a high accuracy measurement system based on machine vision micro-measurement technology, which could measure key dimensions of important parts on-line&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/409"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=409"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/409\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":410,"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/409\/revisions\/410"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/ccvcl.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=409"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
