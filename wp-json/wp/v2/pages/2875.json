The purpose of the project is to make you familiar with the basic digital image formations. No matter what is the programming language you will use, please don\u2019t use the built-in functions for image processing or computer vision, but rather you should write your transformation functions and array operations. Your program should do the following things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>[5 points]&nbsp;<\/strong>Read in a color image C1(x,y) = (R(x,y), G(x,y), B(x,y)) in Windows BMP format, and display it.<\/li><li><strong>[5 points]<\/strong>&nbsp;Display the images of the three color components, R(x,y), G(x,y) and B(x,y), separately. You should display three black-white-like images.<\/li><li><strong>[5 points]<\/strong>&nbsp;Generate an intensity image I(x,y) and display it. You should use the equation I = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B (the NTSC standard for luminance) and tell us what are the differences of the intensity image thus generated from the one using a simple average of the R, G and B components. Please be specific by analyzing your quantitative results rather than just speculation by looking at images.<\/li><li><strong>[10 points]<\/strong>&nbsp;The original intensity image should have K = 256 gray levels.&nbsp; Please uniformly quantize this image into different K levels ( with K=4, 16, 32, 64).&nbsp; As an example,&nbsp; when K=2,&nbsp; pixels whose values are below 128 are turned to 0,&nbsp; otherwise to 255.&nbsp; Display the four quantized images with four different K levels&nbsp; and tell us&nbsp; how the images still look like the original ones.<\/li><li><strong>[10 points]<\/strong>&nbsp;Quantize&nbsp; the original three-band color image C1(x,y) into color images CK(x,y)= (R'(x,y), G'(x,y), B'(x,y)) (with uniform intervals for each band having K levels) , and display them. You may choose K=2 and 4 (for each band).&nbsp; Do they have any advantages in viewing and\/or in computer processing (e.g. segmentation)? Please be specific on your chosen image(s).<\/li><li><strong>[10 points]<\/strong>&nbsp;Please transform the original RGB image into (1) an HSI image, and (2) a YUV image, and display each band individually into a gray scale image. You may use the equation on the slides of I-4 for YUV, but you will have to figure out what are the equations from RGB to HSI. Please give some intuitive explanation of each band, and their relations if any.<\/li><li><strong>[25 points]<\/strong>. Suppose you apply the Sobel operator to each of the RGB color bands of a color image.&nbsp; How might you combine these results into a color edge detector<strong> (5 points)<\/strong>?&nbsp; Do the resulting edge results differ from the gray scale results?&nbsp; How and why <strong>(5 points)<\/strong>? You may compare the edge maps of the intensity image (of the color image), the gray-scale edge map that are the combination of the three edge maps from three color bands, or a real color edge map that edge points have colors <strong>(5 points)<\/strong>. Please discuss their similarities and differences, and how each of them can be used for image enhancement or feature extraction<strong> (5 points).<\/strong> Note that you want to first generate gradient maps and then using thresholding to generate edge maps.&nbsp; In the end, please try to generate a color sketch of an image, such as the ID image of Prof. Zhu. You may also consider local, adaptive thresholding in generating a color edge map <strong>(5 points)<\/strong>.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Please for each of the above, provide your analysis \/ observations \/ conclusions, rather than just show the experimental results in images and\/or charts.<\/strong>&nbsp;I have provided a piece of&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www-cs.engr.ccny.cuny.edu\/~zhu\/CSCI6716-2018s\/Homework\/ImageFormat.m\">starting code<\/a>&nbsp;for you to use, in which Questions 1 and 2 have been done.
