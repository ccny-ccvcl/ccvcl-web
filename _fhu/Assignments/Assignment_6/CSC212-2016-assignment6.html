    <hr> <dt> <b>The Assignment:</b></dt>
    <dd> Implement the bag template class from Section 10.5, using a
      binary search tree to store the items.</dd>
    <dt> <b>Purposes:</b></dt>
    <dd> Ensure that you understand and can use binary search tree.</dd>
    <dt> <b>Before Starting:</b></dt>
    <dd> Read all of Chapter 10, especially Sections 10.3 and 10.5.</dd>
    <dt> <b>Due Dates:</b></dt>
    <blockquote> <dt>Monday, November 28,  2016. If you run into
        hardware or software problems, you may submit on Wednesday with
        no penalty. You may submit on Friday or Saturday with a small
        penalty. No submissions will be accepted after Saturday.</dt>
    </blockquote>
    <dt> <b>How to Turn In:</b></dt>
    <blockquote> <dt> Please submit homeworks using <a
          href="../Assignment_Submission_System/upload.html">this link</a>.
        On the upload page, you can select the file(s) you want to
        submit (multiple files can be selected by pressing down CTRL key
        while selecting the files). Then enter your last name and the
        last 4 digit of your student ID (from CUNYfirst, NOT your
        SSN!!!). Once successfully submitted, it will show a page with
        RECEIPT NUMBER, save that number or that page because you will
        need it to retrieve your grade for that assignment. You can
        submit your assignment as many times as you want before the
        deadline, only the latest one will be graded.<br>
        <br>
        To retrieve your grade for an assignment (after I finish grading
        it), please go to the download page <a
          href="../Assignment_Submission_System/download.html">here</a>,
        select the assignment, enter the receipt number for that
        assignment, your last name and your last 4 digit of your student
        ID. The page will then download a TXT file which contain your
        graded submission.</dt>
    </blockquote>
    <dt> <b>Files that you must write and turn in :</b></dt>
    <ol>
      <li> <tt>bag6.h:</tt> Header file for this version of the bag
        class. You don't have to write much of this file. Just copy our
        version from <a href="bag6.h">bag6.h</a> and add your name and
        other information at the top.</li>
      <li> <tt>bag6.template:</tt> The implementation file for the new
        bag class. I have written much of this to get you started. You
        can download my starting file from <a href="bag6.template">bag6.template</a></li>
      <br>
      NOTE: Some of you have been forgetting to put your name and a
      clearly written invariant at the top of this file. I will start
      taking off points for such omissions. In any case, there are four
      functions in this implementation file that you must implement.
      These files are marked with the words <tt>STUDENT WORK</tt>
    </ol>
    <dt> <b>Other files that you may find helpful:</b></dt>
    <ol>
      <li> <tt>bintree.h:</tt> and <tt>bintree.template</tt> This is
        the binary tree node template class from Section 10.3. You can
        download them from <a href="bintree.h">bintree.h</a> and <a
          href="bintree.template">bintree.template</a></li>
      <p><br>
        <b>NOTE:</b>This version of the binary tree node has a small
        change from the original version that appears in the first
        printing of the second edition of the textbook ( and has a major
        change from the version in the first edition of the book!). In
        particular, the authors have changed the return values from the
        non-const versions of the <tt>left()</tt> and <tt>right()</tt>
        functions so that they return a reference to the pointer in the
        node. This is indicated by the &amp; symbol here: </p>
      <pre>&nbsp; binary_tree_node*&amp; left( )</pre>
      The use of a "reference" (indicated by the ampersand) in the
      return value has two advantages that simplify the material of
      Chapter 10:
      <ul>
        <li> It now allows a direct assignment such as: p-&gt;left() =
          NULL. This is not a huge advantage since the same thing can be
          accomplished by using the set_left function.</li>
        <li> The expression <tt>p-&gt;left()</tt> can be passed as the
          argument to a function such as: <tt>tree_clear(p-&gt;left());</tt>
          The parameter of <tt>tree_clear</tt> is a reference
          parameter, so that any changes that <tt>tree_clear</tt> makes
          to <tt>p-&gt;left()</tt> will now affect the actual left
          pointer in the node <tt>*p</tt>. In this example, the <tt>tree_clear</tt>
          function does set its parameter to NULL, so that the total
          effect of <tt>tree_clear(p-&gt;left())</tt> is to clear the
          left subtree of p and to set p's left pointer to NULL.</li>
      </ul>
      In the case of <tt>tree_clear</tt>, this is not a huge advantage
      because we could have just set p's left pointer to NULL ourselves.
      <b>But, in this assignment, there are two functions, <tt>bst_remove</tt>
        and <tt>bst_remove_max</tt>, which are easier to write if we
        can use <tt>p-&gt;left()</tt> and <tt>p-&gt;right()</tt> as
        the parameters of recursive calls.</b> See my implementations in
      bag6.template for details.
      <li> <tt><a href="bagtest.cxx">bagtest.cxx:</a></tt> A simple
        interactive test program.</li>
      <li> <tt><a href="bagexam.cxx">bagexam.cxx:</a></tt> A
        non-interactive test program that will be used to grade the
        correctness of your bag class.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3> The Bag Class Using a Binary Search Tree<br>
      Discussion of the Assignment</h3>
    Start by understanding the entire pseudocode for the binary search
    tree operations (from Section 10.5). Then read through the portions
    that I have already implemented for you. Implement the rest of your
    work in two parts: (1) The insert and count functions, and (2) The
    bst_remove_all and bst_remove_max functions. Don't move to step 2
    until you have completely finished and tested step 1.
    <p>Since this is a template class, debugging can be more difficult
      (some debuggers don't permit breakpoints in a template function.
      To help in debugging, you can call b.debug() in a program to print
      the binary search tree for the bag b (using the format shown on
      page 484). </p>
    <p>If you use a makefile, you must also be careful in specifying
      what files are to be compiled. For example: </p>
    <pre>bagexam: bagexam.o<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g++ -Wall -gstabs bagexam.o -o bagexam<br><br>bagexam.o: bagexam.cxx bag6.h bag6.template bintree.h bintree.template<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g++ -c -Wall -gstabs bagexam.cxx</pre>
    The bag and bintree templates are never compiled on their own, but
    in order to create bagexam.o, all the template files must be present
    in the current directory.
    <p>Most of your grade will be based on the correctness of your
      implementation. However, I will also look at your work and assign
      some points for clarity and programming style. Make sure that your
      name is on all your work. </p>
