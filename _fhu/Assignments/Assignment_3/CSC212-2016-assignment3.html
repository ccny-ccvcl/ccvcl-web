    <h3> The sequence Class Using a Dynamic Array<br>
      Discussion of the Assignment</h3>
    Your sequence class for this assignment will differ from the your
    previous sequence in the following ways:
    <ul>
      <li> The number of items which may be stored in the sequence
        should only be limited by the amount of memory available on the
        heap. When new items are added to a sequence which is at
        capacity, the size of the data array in which items are stored
        should be automatically enlarged.</li>
      <li> Because you are dynamically allocation memory within your
        sequence class, you will need to define a copy constructor, an
        assignment operator, and a destructor.</li>
      <li> The constructor should have a default argument which allows
        the user to set the initial capacity of the sequence.</li>
      <li> There should be a resize function that allows the user to
        explicitly set the the capacity of the sequence.</li>
    </ul>
    Start by declaring the new sequence's private member variables in
    sequence2.h. This should include the dynamic array (which is
    declared as a pointer to a value_type). You will also need two
    size_type variables to keep track of the number of items in the
    sequence and the total size of the dynamic array. After you've
    declared your member variables, write an invariant for the top of
    sequence2.cxx.
    <p>Many of the features of this class are similar to the <b>bag</b>
      class from Section 4.3, so start by thoroughly reading Section 4.3
      and pay attention to new features such as how the sequence differs
      from a bag (see page 119). Also the implementation of some of the
      functions are almost the same as in Part 1. Once again, do your
      work in small pieces. For example, my first version of the
      sequence had only a constructor, start, insert, advance, and
      current. My other member functions started out as stubs. </p>
    <p>Use the interactive test program and the debugger to track down
      errors in your implementation. If you have an error, <i>do not
        start making changes until you have identified the cause of the
        error.</i> </p>
    <p><i>The ability to initialize and use a static member constant
        within the class definition is a relatively new feature. If you
        have an older compiler</i><i> (for example, Visual C++ 6.0)</i><i>
        that does not support static const members, then you may use</i>
    </p>
    <p><i>enum {DEFAULT_CAPACITY = 30};</i> </p>
    <p><i>instead of</i> </p>
    <p><i>static const size_type DEFAULT_CAPACITY = 30;</i> </p>
    <p><i>After&nbsp; this definition, the name bag::DEFAULT_CAPACITY is
        defined to have the integer value 30. Although this is not the
        intended use of an enum definition, the result is the same as
        using a static member constant (see more discussions at page 99
        in the textbook).</i> </p>
    <p>When a member functions needs to increase the size of the dynamic
      array, it is a good idea to increase that size by at least 10%
      (rather than by just one item). <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <h3> The sequence Class Using a Dynamic Array<br>
      *Optional Part of the Assignment (for extra 10% points )</h3>
    You may wish to provide some additional useful member functions,
    such as <br>
    (1) Operators + and +=.. For + operator, x+y contains all the items
    of x, followed by all the items in y. The statement x += y appends
    all the items in y to the end of what's already in x. <br>
    (2) Operator []. For a sequence x, we would like to be able to refer
    to the individual items using the usual C++ notation for arrays. For
    example, if x has three items, then we want to be able to write
    x[0], x[1] and x[2] to access these three items. The use of the
    square brackets is called the subscript operator. The subscript
    operator may be overloaded as a member function, with the prototype
    shown here as part of the sequence class:
    <p>class sequence <br>
      { <br>
      public: <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; value_type operator[](size_type index) const; <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... <br>
      }; </p>
    <p>The only parameter is the index of the item we want to retrieve.
      The implementation of this member function should check that the
      index is valid, and then return the specified item. <br>
